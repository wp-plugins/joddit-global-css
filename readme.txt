Simple Custom CSS in WordPress: Create and manage custom stylesheets with a powerful CSS editor based on the CodeMirror JavaScript component.

== Description ==

This plugin allows WordPress admins the ability to add and organize custom stylesheets within a friendly, familiar interface. The plugin also brings in the functionality of the CodeMirror JavaScript syntax highlighter component. This allows you to see your CSS in easily recognizable color patterns that will help you catch mistakes as you write.

== Screenshots ==

1. The WordPress plugin main dashboard.
2. The individual stylesheet editor using CodeMirror for line counts, coloring and general styling.

2. Activate the Joddit Global Stylesheet plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Click on the new Global CSS menu item and create a stylesheet.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change the color scheme in the CSS editor? =

You can only change the color scheme of the CSS editor by modifying the core plugin code. I will be building a settings page where you will be able to do this in future releases.
